/*
A Simple Car Loan Payment Calculator
Letâ€™s combine a few of the concepts that you have learned so far: conditionals, Boolean expressions, and arithmethic expressions.

In this project, you will write a program that will calculate the monthly car payment a user should expect to make after taking out a car loan. The program will include the following:

Car loan amount
Interest rate of the loan
Length of the loan (in years)
Down payment



*/
public class CarLoan {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
    int carLoan = 10000;
    int loanLength = 3;
    int interestRate = 5;
    int downPayment = 2000;

    //Pprevent a buyer from taking out an invalid car loan
    if(loanLength <= 0 || interestRate <= 0) {
      System.out.println("Error! You must take out a valid car loan.");
    }
    //down payment is more than the price of the car?
    else if(downPayment >= carLoan) {
      System.out.println("The car can be paid in full.");
    } else {
      int remainingBalance = carLoan - downPayment;
      int months = loanLength * 12;
      int monthlyBalance = remainingBalance/months;
      int interest = (monthlyBalance * interestRate ) / 100;
      int monthlyPayment = monthlyBalance + interest;
      System.out.println(monthlyPayment);
    }
